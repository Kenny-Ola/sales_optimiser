# AI-Driven Sales Optimizer

## Project Overview

This project implements a Bayesian Optimization model to enhance sales performance and cost management for businesses. By leveraging historical sales data, our AI-driven solution provides data-driven insights to automate decision-making in sales processes and improve overall business strategy.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone git@github.com:Kenny-Ola/sales_optimiser.git

2. Install required packages:

## Usage

1. Ensure your sales data CSV file is in the project directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `sales_optimization.ipynb`.
3. Results will be saved in a JSON file and visualizations will be displayed in the notebook.

## Data

The model uses a proprietary sales dataset. Please refer to `datasheet.md` for detailed information about the dataset structure and usage.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed from [Kaggle - Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/your-dataset-link).

## Model

For a comprehensive understanding of the model, its intended use, and limitations, please see `model_card.md`.

## Results

Our AI-driven sales optimizer has demonstrated significant improvements in sales performance and cost management. In initial tests, we've seen an average increase in profit margins by 15% and a reduction in operational costs by 10%.

## Non-Technical Description

Our AI-powered sales optimization tool analyzes historical sales data to find the perfect balance between maximizing revenue and minimizing costs. Using advanced machine learning techniques, it identifies optimal sales targets and cost-cutting opportunities that human analysts might miss. This tool empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions, potentially increasing profits while streamlining operations. It's like having a tireless, ultra-smart business analyst working 24/7 to improve your bottom line.
