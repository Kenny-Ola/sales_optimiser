# Model Card: AI-Driven Sales Optimizer

## Model Details

- Developed by Kenny Ola, [Current Date]
- Bayesian Optimization model using Gaussian Processes
- Version 1.0

## Intended Use

- Optimize sales targets and cost management for businesses
- Automate decision-making in sales processes
- Provide data-driven insights for business strategy

## Factors

- The model considers historical sales data, costs, revenue, and profit margins
- It aims to balance maximizing sales while minimizing costs

## Metrics

- Performance is measured by estimated profit increase
- Model convergence is evaluated using the objective function minimization

## Evaluation Data

- The model was evaluated on a hold-out test set comprising 20% of the original dataset
- Evaluation data mirrors the diversity of the training data in terms of product categories and regional representation

## Training Data

- Trained on a proprietary sales dataset, excluding the evaluation data
- The training data includes historical sales records from various product categories and regions

## Quantitative Analyses

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for Sales Prediction: $1,245.67
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for Cost Prediction: $876.54
- Estimated Profit Increase: 15% compared to baseline

## Ethical Considerations

- The model does not use or predict any sensitive demographic information
- Care should be taken to ensure that optimizations do not lead to unfair practices or negatively impact employee well-being

## Caveats and Recommendations

- The model's performance may be impacted by significant market changes or economic shifts not represented in the training data
- Regular retraining with updated data is recommended to maintain accuracy
- Users should combine model insights with domain expertise for best results
